    <h1>About Us</h1><br>
    Smile Foundation, an NGO for poor child education, is an NGO in India directly
     benefitting over 15,00,000 children and their families every year, through
      more than 400 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and wo
men empowerment, in over 2000 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.
Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means
 because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen.
Doubtless, education is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. 
But child education cannot be done in isolation. A child will go to school only if th
e family, particularly the mother, is assured of healthcare and empowered. 
Moreover, when an elder sibling is relevantly skilled to be employable and begins
 earning, the journey of empowerment continues beyond the present generation.

    The best of us have faced issues while trying to find a job. So, one 
    can only imagine what it is like for the child of two illiterate menial labourers.
    Vishal is one such individual. He was able to complete his second pre-university course with a great deal of effort. However, financial issues prevented him from studying f
     As a result, he started looking for a job to support his parents who work as daily wagers.
     He came to know from his friends about the STeP centre where you can gain training to become a healthcare professional.
